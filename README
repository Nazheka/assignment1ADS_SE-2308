This is the assignment 1 of algorithms and Data Structures from Akezhan Bakytzhanov SE-2308
This Java program contains a menu which has 10 tasks from assssignment you can pick by writng a nummber from 1 to 10. 
After that you will be given task's information and what you should input from keyboard. 
After your input the results will display including time complexity and runtime.
Tasks contain recursions and math formulas. 
Each task contain comments about code and time complexity. 

Here is a brief overview of all functions:
`findMinInArray`: O(n) - Iterates through each element of the array once to find the minimum value.
`findAverageInArray`: O(n) - Calculates the sum of all elements in the array, iterating through each element once.
`isPrime`: O(sqrt(n)) - Checks divisibility up to the square root of the input number.
`findFactorial`: O(n) - Uses recursion to calculate the factorial of the input number.
`findFibonacci`: O(2^n) - Uses recursion to calculate Fibonacci numbers.
`findPower`: O(n) - Uses recursion to calculate the power of a number.
`returnReversedArray`: O(n) - Uses recursion to reverse the elements of an array.
`isFullDigits`: O(n) - Uses recursion to check if each character in a string is a digit.
`findBinomialCoefficient`: O(2^n) - Uses recursion to calculate binomial coefficients.
`findGCD`: O(log(min(a, b))) - Uses the Euclidean Algorithm to find the greatest common divisor.
